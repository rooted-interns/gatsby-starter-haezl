My name is Alexandria wills, my internship was at Loyal University called Electric girls. I was asked to help girls from ages 12 and under teach them how to code and do some basic engineering that you normally wouldn't see girls at these ages do. While teaching them I also taught myself things that they were learning to help better my understanding on how to help the girls more when they needed help. This internship help me better my skills as a leader, have more confidence in helping others, and learn more about engineering. My experience at Electric girls was really exciting and I would love to take part in this experience again. The skills that I learned was mainly soldering, how to light up LEDs, and how to do things such as parallel circuits.

As I said previously, I am Saidi Zelaya. For the summer of 2018, Rooted gave me the opportunity to intern with Electric Girls. Electric girls is non-profit organization in New Orleans that teach girls from the ages of 5 to 14. The girls, through a two week period, they learn the basics engineering work such as soldering, how to use a drillpress. They help girls boost their confidence
