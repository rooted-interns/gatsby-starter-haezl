Hi again, my name is Saidi. As I said before, Rooted

My internship at Lucid has been splendid so far! At first I remembered that we did research about what Lucid does, the concept was still confusing however we got the hang of everything when we got there.
Lucid helps connect companies with real human answers on a global scale. Lucid does so with surveys, they have surveys before the actual survey of the company. The survey is called a pre-screener, the pre-screener asks the suppliers questions related to what kind of people the company is looking for. The whole Lucid work is now very understandable to me.

As for what we were doing, at first Marcus told us about a page that they were trying to find bugs so that it is ready for them to move all their surveys data. So at first we were finding bugs within the website, then write a whole process on how we found them. However, the process was getting boring. We did acquire a lot of information and I am glad for that. We now know a lot of information and how it is to work at an office. By the second week, we were introduced to the project that Justice and I were going to work on. The project included understanding how to work with the terminal, git hub, gatsby(which is a static Progressive web app generator.), and many other coding programs. We now understand how to host a webpage and how to put it into the web, we understand that now we don’t actually need to understand every piece of coding to create our own website.

For our final project, Justice and I decided to choose a framework from gatsby. A framework that will let us write blogs for other people to see. The website is about Rooted students writing their own experience in a blog and then we publish it into the website. We decided to do this because as I recalled, we didn’t have a lot of information when we applied for the internship at Lucid, we had no idea what to do. So we wanted other students to get educated about what should they expect at an internship, and experiences written by previous interns. We did this project using Scrum, Marcus helped us understand Scrum more in depth and how to apply it to our project.When Justice and I didn’t understand something, we would try it first, look it up on google, try different methods possible, and when we were too stressed out we would take a mental break and then get back on it. We also asked Marcus if we really didn’t understand something. Marcus would give us tips on how to do something, or another method that we didn’t know.

In summary, the internship at Lucid has been great. I am grateful that I was able to get it, I have learned a lot and expanded my skills in coding, critical thinking, and I got better at asking for help when it’s necessary. We have received a lot of information as well as to how to work with Scrum.
