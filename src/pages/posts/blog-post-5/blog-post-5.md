Steven --Hey, my name is Steven Calloway and i’m an intern at the company Search Influence and i’m going to talk about my experience with working here. Search Influence is by far one of the most chill and fun companies you can work at ever. Walking into the company it’s most likely going to be quiet, the only thing you’ll really hear is keyboard keys clicking, then comes 9:00 am when it’s time for the morning meeting where we go over our goals and status updates for the week and day, it may sound hectic but it’s actually really organized. Now when it comes to the work there isn’t much to fear at all because the work is very easy to catch on to so after about two days you’ll have the hang of it you’ll be right at home. That’s most of what you need to know about an internship process at the company Search Influence.

Marche --Search Influence is an awesome company. The people are welcoming and very nice. They help you get your way through the company. They teach you and work alongside of you. They have daily meetings that track their progress throughout the week and help them learn what tasks are a priority.

In all, Search Influence is a great company to work at and interned with. I look forward with future opportunities involving them.
