## Rooted Students

This website was created by [Saidi Zelaya](https://github.com/SaidiElle) and [Justice Matthews](https://github.com/Demonitized) using a Gatsby framework. We decided to do this because we are both fond of coding, and we wanted a project and a challenge.

For some reason every internship that we get is always nerve wracking. As students have so little information, sometimes we ask our teachers questions that they are unable to answer, or we have no idea if we are actually ready for an internship, and more.

This is the reason why we wanted to do this. We wanted students to understand everything when they apply for an internship. We noticed that we struggled because we don't have the information necessary. I remembered I asked one of my teachers, "What are we going to do there(at the internship)?", and he fell into a deep thought and answered, "I don't know," at first I was going insane. What should I do? How should I even dress? Are they going to wear suits? What exactly am I going to do? I remembered that Rooted is a place where students can also rely in their peers for answers, we wanted to help other students, and we also wanted for them to share their experience so that it is helpful for more students.

We want every student at Rooted to share their experience with us, so we can publish it in this blog and help more students in the long run. Also, this blog is not only limited to students with internships, we want all of the students at Rooted to engage with the content. Any student at Rooted can write for this blog as long as it explains us why we should publish it.

We hope to receive an email from you here at [Rooted Insights](rootedinsights@gmail.com) about any glitches and bugs on the site and if you have more ideas on how to make this page or the content more engaging, we would appreciate it very much.
