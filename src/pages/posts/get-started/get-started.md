title: "Rooted Internship Program"
date: "2019-04-10"
description: "Our students were stationed amongst our partners throughout New Orleans and applied their knowledge from school into the real world. They may have faced many challenges, but in the end they overpowered their resistance. In 2018, students interned and volunteered with Electric Girls, Code Nola, and Entrescan. For our second year, some students received hands on help with Entrescan. While other students interned in companies such as Search Influence and Lucid."

## Internships
When Rooted first opened, all of the students were offered many opportunities that included internships in tech companies that will eventually achieve our goal of financial freedom.
 As high school students, we took certifications that many adults take in their college years such as Autodesk Inventor for 3D printing, Frond End Web Design, Inbound Sales, and many more. Every Rooted Student in their first year earn at least two certifications.

Asides from the certifications, the school also offers internship opportunities and suggestions to those students who want to excel and seek their own paths. This year alone, Rooted offered three different internships at Tech companies such as Search Influence, Entrescan, and Lucid. We felt as though the students should understand the experience as well as parents, this blog contains many written experience done by our peers giving us an explanation to what it is like at the internship, and if it is worth the try.
